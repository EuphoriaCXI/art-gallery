## Brief / Thoughts while completing project

It's been a little over a year since I've actively coded with Frontendmentor. I really enjoyed how precise seniors would look at your code and give honest, real world answers.

## Summary

- It took me a good 5-6 days consisting of 5-6 hours a day
- It was my first time working with a Figma file and getting used to the way you use padding, margin and finding out if components where flexed, etc
- Towards the end I got fatigue due to how long I spent, so the class names aren't the most creative
- I did not use pseudo elements such as ::before and ::after on images as I feel the images have relevance to the content

## Mistakes seniors will most likely pick up on that I haven't addressed

- Not using aria label enough
- Better organisation with class names
- Better element nesting (such buttons)
- Organisation in CSS
- Not using CSS as clean as I should (repeating)
- Relying heavily on margin / padding, when I could've broken it into components to save time
- Not using rem / em enough
- Anything else I missed that I would really like to know
- Need to improve Flex / Grid

## Technology I've taught and used for the first time

- I learnt Grid and used it alot more then I thought
- I learnt how to use the picture element with source and why it's important
- I learnt myself how to use SVG in HTML

## Quesitions I have

- The "third-box" image seems to be the only one that scales which I didn't want, how can I fix that
- Is my overall responsive design corret? For example, my content on tablet doesn't expand with the hero / footer due to fixed width
- On desktop, once the viewport is passed 1440px, it doens't stop moving. How do I make it not move past the width?

Thanks for taking the time to read this!
